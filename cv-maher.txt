Research Interests

I am interested in the problem of programming parallel machines.  My interests include the language and compilation technology that allow a programmer to write correct concurrent programs, and the underlying architecture that supports efficient parallel execution.

Research Experience

[9/2004--present] Research assistant, UT-Austin. 
Advisor: Doug Burger.
Researched compilation techniques for the TRIPS prototype processor.  Implemented convergent hyperblock formation, which resolves phase ordering problems among hyperblock formation, loop unrolling, and scalar optimizations by iteratively growing and optimizing hyperblocks.

[9/2003--5/2004] Senior thesis, Yale University. 
Advisor: Brian Scassellati 
Designed, built, and programmed a microcontroller-based device to test the listening preferences of autistic children, in collaboration with faculty at the Yale Child Studies Center.


Teaching Experience

[1/2008--present] Teaching assistant, UT-Austin. 
Led discussion sections of 20-30 students and prepared and graded homework assignments for an introductory computer architecture and assembly language class.
[9/2002--12/2002] Teaching assistant, Yale University. 
Helped lead a sophomore level circuits laboratory of 20-30 students.


Work Experience

[6/2008--8/2008] Software engineering intern, Intel Corp. 
Developed tools for Pin, a dynamic binary instrumentation system, for finding differences between executions of programs with nondeterministic behavior, and for finding implementation differences between simulation tools and hardware.
[6/1999--8/2004] Software developer, Innovative Managed Care Systems, Ltd. 
Worked during summers as a software developer, designing data acquisition software using Perl and web applications for modeling insurance contract changes using Visual Basic.


Professional Service

Student member, UTCS Faculty Recruiting Committee, Spring 2008.
Representative, Graduate Representative Association of Computer Sciences, 9/2005--5/2006.
Reviewer, IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC) 2006.
